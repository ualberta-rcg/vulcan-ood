  Launch [OpenRefine] on the [Vulcan] high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, powered by [AMII], the [University of Alberta], and supported by the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada].

  OpenRefine is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; extending it with web services; and linking it to databases.

  Jobs are scheduled with [SLURM], and you can request CPU and memory resources for your OpenRefine environment.
