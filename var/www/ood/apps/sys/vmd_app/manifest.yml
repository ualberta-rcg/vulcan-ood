  Launch a [VMD] session on the [Vulcan] high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, operated by [AMII], the [University of Alberta], and supported by the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada].

  VMD runs from a restricted CVMFS path or local installation and may require appropriate licensing or institutional approval for use. If you do not have access to the VMD binaries, this application will not start.

  You will interact with the VMD GUI through a VNC session. GPU acceleration is available if selected.
