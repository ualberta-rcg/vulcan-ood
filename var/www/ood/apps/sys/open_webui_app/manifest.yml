  Launch [Open WebUI] on the [Vulcan] high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, powered by [AMII], the [University of Alberta], and supported by the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada].

  Open WebUI is an extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly self-hosted WebUI designed to operate entirely offline. It supports various LLM runners, including Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs.

  Jobs are scheduled with [SLURM], and you can request CPU and memory resources for your Open WebUI environment.
