  Launch a [MATLAB] session on the [Vulcan] high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, operated by [AMII], the [University of Alberta], and supported by the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada].

  MATLAB runs from a restricted CVMFS path and requires a valid [MathWorks] license to function. If you do not have access to a license, this application will not start.

  You will interact with the MATLAB GUI through a VNC session. GPU acceleration is available if selected.
