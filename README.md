## Description

This repository contains the complete configuration files, scripts, and application definitions for **Open OnDemand (OOD) deployment on the Vulcan HPC cluster** - a Digital Research Alliance of Canada compute resource operated by the University of Alberta as part of the PAICE (Platform for Advanced Infrastructure and Computing Excellence) initiative.

The goal is to provide a reproducible setup for OOD using Apache, OIDC authentication, and Let's Encrypt SSL. This repository serves as a template that can be adapted for other HPC clusters.

**Key Features:**
- **Production-ready OOD deployment** with OIDC authentication
- **Pre-configured applications** (Jupyter, RStudio, VS Code, MATLAB, ParaView, etc.)
- **Automated configuration** via cron scripts for cluster discovery
- **Multi-language support** (English-Canadian and French-Canadian)
- **University of Alberta branding** with AMII partnership integration
- **Globus file transfer** integration for high-speed data movement

## Documentation

- **[INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md)** - Step-by-step installation guide for Ubuntu 24.04
- **[REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md)** - System requirements and prerequisites
- **[CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md)** - Configuration files and deployment settings
- **[REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md](./REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md)** - Complete repository structure and components

---

## Quick Start

To deploy this OOD configuration on your cluster:

1. **Review requirements** - Ensure your system meets the prerequisites in [REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md)
2. **Follow installation** - Use the step-by-step guide in [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md)
3. **Customize configuration** - Update settings for your cluster as documented in [CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md)
4. **Deploy applications** - Copy the pre-configured applications and templates to your OOD installation

**Key Customization Points:**
- **Cluster configuration** - Update hostnames, SLURM settings, and partition names
- **Authentication** - Configure OIDC provider and SSSD integration
- **Branding** - Replace University of Alberta references with your institution
- **Applications** - Modify resource limits and add/remove applications as needed

**Note**: Cluster information (partitions, GPUs, application versions) is automatically generated by cron scripts - no manual editing required.
