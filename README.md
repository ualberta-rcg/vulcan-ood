## Description

This repository contains the complete configuration files, scripts, and application definitions for deploying **Open OnDemand (OOD) on the Vulcan HPC cluster** - a Digital Research Alliance of Canada compute resource operated by **[AMII (Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute)](https://www.amii.ca/)** and the **University of Alberta** as part of the PAICE (Platform for Advanced Infrastructure and Computing Excellence) initiative.

The project provides a production-ready, reproducible setup for OOD using Apache, OIDC authentication, and Let's Encrypt SSL. This repository serves as both a working deployment for Vulcan and a comprehensive template that can be adapted for other HPC clusters and institutions.

**Key Features:**
- **Production-ready OOD deployment** with OIDC authentication
- **Pre-configured applications** (Jupyter, RStudio, VS Code, MATLAB, ParaView, etc.)
- **Automated configuration** via cron scripts for cluster discovery
- **Multi-language support** (English-Canadian and French-Canadian)
- **University of Alberta branding** with **[AMII partnership](https://www.amii.ca/)** integration
- **Globus file transfer** integration for high-speed data movement

## Documentation

- **[INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md)** - Step-by-step installation guide for Ubuntu 24.04
- **[REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md)** - System requirements and prerequisites
- **[CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md)** - Configuration files and deployment settings
- **[REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md](./REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md)** - Complete repository structure and components

## Quick Start

To deploy this OOD configuration on your cluster:

1. **Review requirements** - Ensure your system meets the prerequisites in [REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md)
2. **Follow installation** - Use the step-by-step guide in [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md)
3. **Customize configuration** - Update settings for your cluster as documented in [CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md)
4. **Deploy applications** - Copy the pre-configured applications and templates to your OOD installation

**Key Customization Points:**
- **Cluster configuration** - Update hostnames, SLURM settings, and partition names
- **Authentication** - Configure OIDC provider and SSSD integration
- **Branding** - Replace University of Alberta references with your institution
- **Applications** - Modify resource limits and add/remove applications as needed

**Note**: Cluster information (partitions, GPUs, application versions) is automatically generated by cron scripts - no manual editing required.
